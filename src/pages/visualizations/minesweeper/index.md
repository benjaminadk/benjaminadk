## Notes

Recently I was scheduled to interview for a position and the company sent some preparation material. One of the suggested assignments was to create a command line version of _Minesweeper_. I decided it would be cooler to build a graphic version since I had been messing around with _Svg_ and [D3](https://d3js.org) alot recently. I ended up with a new appreciation for the power of _Svg_. Aside from the border around the game and the fonts, the rest of the user interface was created using [Boxy Svg](https://boxy-svg.com/).
