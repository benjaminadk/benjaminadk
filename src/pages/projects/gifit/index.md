[GifIt](https://github.com/benjaminadk/gifit) is a desktop application that allows users to record _GIFs_ from their desktop, webcam or a built in white board. This application is built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and is available Windows. My goal was to reverse engineer [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/), a popular application built with _.NET_ and written in _C#_. I was able to build features by playing around with the original version and through a lot of trial and error. This project is not meant for distribution, but is a showcase of my problem solving skills and general _JavaScript_ ability.

The _Desktop Recorder_ captures a series of images that can later be editted an encoded into a _GIF_. A possible use case of this feature is to record an interactive component or an animation. Recently, I designed my own version of the classic game [Minesweeper](/visualizations/minesweeper). The _Desktop Recorder_ allows me to select the specific region of the screen I want to record so I can show off my skills as both a developer and as a sweeper of mines.
