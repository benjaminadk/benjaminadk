## Overview

[GifIt]() is a desktop application that allows users to record _GIFs_ from their desktop, webcam or a built in white board. This application is built with [Electron](), [React]() and [Node]() and is available Windows. My goal was to reverse engineer [ScreenToGif](), a popular application built with _.NET_ and written in _C#_. I was able to build features by playing around with the original version and through a lot of trial and error. This project is not meant for distribution, but is a showcase of my problem solving skills and general _JavaScript_ ability.
