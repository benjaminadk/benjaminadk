I created the _Exam Simulator_ prototype as a free alternative to _VCE_ format exam simulators. While my _Exam Simulator_ can be used for any type of test, I saw a huge hole in the technical certification market. There are many sites that charge high fees to download _VCE_ files or to purchase their exam simulators. Companies can do so because _VCE_ files are binary and it seems that much of the code capable of reading them is proprietary. It all makes sense financially. I feel like a free or lower cost alternative using _JSON_ could gain a large share of the market if enough time and resources were invested. If a _JSON_ based system is financially viable is another question.
