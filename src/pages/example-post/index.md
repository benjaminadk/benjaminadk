The goal of the post is to get up and running as simply as possible. [Electron]() is a JavaScript framework for creating cross-platform desktop applications. Translation - you can make stuff that will run on Windows, MacOS and Linux all from the same source code. And here were **go with the boldness** and lets not forget the _italic text here_ and of course the always in style `inline code example`.

# What is Electron

## What is React

<div class='filename'>src/index.js</div>

```javascript
const x = Math.random()

function example(a, b) {
  let obj = {a: 'string', b: 12, c: [true, false]}
}

var arrow = () => console.log('cool')

class Something extends SomethingElse {
  constructor() {
    super()
  }

  this.whatever = 12
}
```

# Lets make a list

- javascript
- react

numbered list
