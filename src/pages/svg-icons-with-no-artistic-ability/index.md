Are you sick of the icons you have been using in your projects lately? Do you lack the artistic ability to draw a stick figure? If you answered yes or no please continue reading.

Since I began building things with JavaScript I have been using essentially the same icon set over and over. I often work with React and Styled Components so my go-to icon library has been Styled Icons. Styled Icons contains the same familiar icon sets we have probably all used at some point: Font Awesome, Material Design, Boxicons, etc. Even though there are thousands of choices and all of these icon collections are great in their own right, I got to the point where I couldn't find the right icons for my use cases and all my projects sort of looked the same. I thought creating my own icon set was way out of reach due to my complete lack of artistic talent. Turns out I was wrong.

The solution to my problem was SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics. To get started you will need some kind of SVG editor. Here is [a list of 7 free SVG editors](https://www.maketecheasier.com/free-graphic-editor-for-creating-vector-image/). I use [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com/).
